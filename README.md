On a Debian or an Ubuntu system there is a file called /var/lib/dpkg/status that holds information about software packages that the system knows about. Write a small program that exposes some key information about currently installed packages via a html interface. The program should listen to http requests on port 8080 on localhost and provide the following features:

- The index page lists installed packages alphabetically with package names as links.
- When following each link, you arrive at an information about a single package. The following information should be included:
 - Name
 - Description
 - The names of the packages the current package depends on (skip version numbers)
 - The names of the packages that depend on the current package
- The dependencies and reverse dependencies should be clickable and the user can navigate the package structure by clicking from package to package.

Some things to keep in mind:
- Minimize the use of external dependencies.
 - The goal of the assignment is to view how you solve the problems with the programming language, not how well you use package managers :)
- The main design goal of this program is maintainability.
- Only look at the Depends field. Ignore other fields that works kind of similarly, such as Suggests and Recommends.
- Sometimes there are alternates in a dependency list, separated by the pipe character (|). When rendering such dependencies, render any alternative that maps to a package name that have an entry in the status file as a link and just print the name of the package name for other packages.
- The section Syntax of control files of the Debian Policy Manual applies to the input data.

## Running

1. Make sure you're using node > 8, or if using [nvmrc](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), you can simply run `nvm use` which will automaticall install required version.

2. In the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

to install required depencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
